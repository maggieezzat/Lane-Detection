    "After finishing the previous steps You now have a thresholded warped image and you're ready to map out the lane lines! There are many ways you could go about this, but here's one example of how you might do it:\n",
    "### Peaks in a Histogram and Sliding Windows\n",
    "* After applying calibration, thresholding, and a perspective transform to a road image, you should have a binary image where the lane lines stand out clearly. However, you still need to decide explicitly which pixels are part of the lines and which belong to the left line and which belong to the right line.\n",
    "* we can use the two highest peaks from our histogram as a starting point for determining where the lane lines are, and then use sliding windows moving upward in the image (further along the road) to determine where the lane lines go.\n",
    "#### steps:\n",
    "  1. split the histogram into two sides, one for each lane line.\n",
    "  2. Set up sliding windows and window hyperparameters:\n",
    "     * set a few hyperparameters related to our sliding windows, and set them up to iterate across the binary activations in the image. These hyperparameters are:\n",
    "        1. **W_Number**; number of sliding windows.\n",
    "        2. **Margin**; the width of each window.\n",
    "        3. **Minimum_pixels**; used as a threshold to recenter the next sliding window.\n",
    "        4. **Window_Height**; computed from number of pixels and image height.\n",
    "  3. Loop through each window in W_Number.\n",
    "  4. Find the boundaries of our current window. This is based on a combination of the current window's starting point      , as well as the margin you set in the hyperparameters.\n",
    "  5. Use cv2.rectangle to draw these window boundaries onto visualization image.\n",
    "  6. Now that we know the boundaries of our window, find out which activated(non zero) pixels actually fall into the window.\n",
    "  7. Append these non zero pixels to two different arrays one for the right line and the other for the left line.\n",
    "  8. If the number of pixels you found in Step **6** are greater than your hyperparameter Minimum_pixels, re-center our window based on the mean position of these pixels.\n",
    "  9. Now that we have found all our pixels belonging to each line through the sliding window method, it's time to fit a polynomial to the line."
